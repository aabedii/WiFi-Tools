make it as a command line input:

* to input how many AMSDUs in MPDUs 
* time limit 
* frame limit
* min of those two 
64 is the limit
* beacon frames can affect efficiency - adjust for this? thesis?


* multiple device AP channel estimation


In Ali's code:

two MSDUs, two payloads--> two aggregated frames instead of 1500 it is now 3000
there are two A-MSDUs in one MPDU

print all the details of overhead backoff etc
compare values obtained here and in our experiment
iPerf view of the throughput
beacon frames and how it changes the view

read the thesis and the Mobicomm paper - IMPORTANT



how many clients are connected to the AP in every 5 min
interval and also max of all those 5 min interval and total number
of different clients connected

4/11/2019:

Check the code by YG
5 min interval from Device to AP, max numbers too
do the efficiency stuff first
get the graphs for efficiency from Ali
