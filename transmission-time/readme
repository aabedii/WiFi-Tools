This program reports the transmission time of a rate and the expected throughput

Things to note:

* Check the changelog file to track the changes
* If you add library support from a C file, compile it using extern


How to read the 80211n_rates file:

* It contains the rates for 802.11g and 802.11n Networks.
* The first 8 lines (0 - 7) belong to 802.11g networks.
* The rest are for 802.11n networks, grouped into 32 rates each with index 0 - 31. 
* The first set of 0 - 31 (line 9 to 40) are for 20 MHz and the remaining 0 - 31 (line 41 to 72) are for 40 MHz.
* Each line of file can be broken down as shown below. Here we have used an example of line 9 in the line.
* It is first one in the first set of 0 - 31 belonging to 802.11n.
