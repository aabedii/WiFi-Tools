make it as a command line input:

* to input how many AMSDUs in MPDUs 
* time limit 
* frame limit
* min of those two 
64 is the limit
* beacon frames can affect efficiency - adjust for this? thesis?


* multiple device AP channel estimation


In Ali's code:

two MSDUs, two payloads--> two aggregated frames instead of 1500 it is now 3000
there are two A-MSDUs in one MPDU
